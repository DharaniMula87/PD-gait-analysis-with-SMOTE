# PD-gait-analysis-with-SMOTE
Parkinson’s Disease stage classification using gait analysis with SMOTE-based class balancing. Machine learning models are trained and tested on gait features extracted from VGRF signals. Results show that SMOTE improves accuracy and prediction performance compared to the original imbalanced dataset.
